// Below are the process of the How to compiler Run the code

// In the java There aretwo things to run the code 
//     1. Compiler 
//     2. Execution

//     1). Compiler == Source code(.java) -> Compiler(Which is in JDK) -> ByteCode(.class) [ByteCode i.e, .class file will be run on the any of the devices like Mac os , Linux etc - That's Why java is called as portable]
//     2). Execution == ByteCode(.class file) -> JVM -> Convert into "Native Code" (Which is in Binary (0 or 1) form) [Any Of the Machine will be easily Understand this Native/Binary Code]
