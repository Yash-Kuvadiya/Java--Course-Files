// In this File I Put the Below Snippet Interview Questions and Compilaton and Execution Process to run a code:


public class Introduction{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Yash");
    }
}






/*
 * class main{    // this is the class, we can write many of the functions in the one class
 *      void main(){
 *              // this is the function, Here We can write a code 
 *     }
 * }
 */

// Below are the process of the How to compiler Run the code

// In the java There aretwo things to run the code 
//     1. Compiler 
//     2. Execution

//     1). Compiler == Source code(.java) -> Compiler(Which is in JDK) -> ByteCode(.class) [ByteCode i.e, .class file will be run on the any of the devices like Mac os , Linux etc - That's Why java is called as portable]
//     2). Execution == ByteCode(.class file) -> JVM -> Convert into "Native Code" (Which is in Binary (0 or 1) form) [Any Of the Machine will be easily Understand this Native/Binary Code]

# General Questions

What is the output of the program?
Answer: Hello Yash

What is the purpose of the main method in Java?
Answer: It is the entry point for Java applications.

What would happen if String[] args in the main method is replaced with String args[]?
Answer: The code will still compile and run because both are valid declarations of an array in Java.

What happens if the main method is not public?
Answer: The program will compile but will result in a runtime error because the main method must be public for the JVM to execute it.


# Syntax and Structure Questions:

Why is the main method declared as static?
Answer: It is static so that the JVM can invoke it without creating an instance of the class.

Can you explain the significance of void in the method declaration?
Answer: It indicates that the method does not return any value.

What would happen if you remove the System.out.println("Hello Yash"); line?
Answer: The program would compile and run, but it would not produce any output.

What happens if you misspell main as Main?
Answer: The JVM will not recognize the method as the entry point, leading to a runtime error.

What would happen if System.out.println is replaced with system.out.println?
Answer: The code will not compile because Java is case-sensitive, and System is a predefined class with a capital "S".


# Conceptual Questions

What is the role of the System.out.println statement?
Answer: It prints the specified message to the console.

What is the difference between System.out.print and System.out.println?
Answer: System.out.print prints the output on the same line, while System.out.println adds a new line after printing.

Can you explain the purpose of args in the main method?
Answer: args is used to accept command-line arguments passed to the program.

What would be the result of running the program with command-line arguments?
Answer: The program would ignore them unless explicitly used in the code.

Is it possible to overload the main method in Java?
Answer: Yes, you can overload the main method, but the JVM will only call the standard main(String[] args).

#Edge Case and Error Questions

What happens if there is no class named Introduction in the file?
Answer: The program will not compile because the filename must match the public class name.

What if the main method is defined as private instead of public?
Answer: The code will compile but will throw a runtime error since the JVM cannot access the main method.

Can you remove static from the main method? What would happen?
Answer: The program will compile, but it will throw a runtime error because the JVM cannot invoke a non-static main method.

What would happen if you replace Hello Yash with a null value?
Answer: The program would print null.

What happens if there is no main method in the class?
Answer: The program will compile but will throw a runtime error stating that the main method is not found.

# Advanced Questions

What is the default access modifier for a class in Java if none is specified?
Answer: package-private.

What happens if you write System.exit(0); before the println statement?
Answer: The program will terminate before printing anything.

Can you write a single-line main method to produce the same output?
Answer: Yes, public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Hello Yash"); }

How does Java handle the execution of multiple classes with main methods in the same project?
Answer: You can choose which class to execute when running the program.

Why does the System.out.println statement not require an import?
Answer: System is part of the java.lang package, which is automatically imported.
